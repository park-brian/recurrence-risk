  This web application has been extended to estimate the risk of progressing to
  distant recurrence using individual survival data. The cause-specific survival
  or relative survival is assumed to follow a mixture-cure model and the risk of
  recurrence is inferred from the survival among the non-cured fraction. The
  cure fraction and parametric survival distribution among those not cured will
  be estimated using R flexsurvcure package. The current version can handle
  Weibull and log-logistic distributions for the non-cured survival.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>CSV Data File:</strong>
    the case-listing unformatted CSV data file exported from SEER*Stat software
    with modification of variables of interest or user-generated individual data
    by other statistical software in the CSV format. Note that, users may not
    directly use the original unformatted variables, but need to modify the
    case-listing SEER*Stat data before uploading because:
    <ol>
      <li>
        It may not contain the event variable for death due to cancer and the
        dead events due to other causes should be recoded as censoring events
      </li>
      <li>
        There may not be categorical but continuous variables for strata and
        covariates
      </li>
      <li>
        The stage/strata/covariates variables are categorical but with many
        levels or with numerical unknown values, the user will need to recode it
        to better categorize the group
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Strata:</strong>
    the user-defined strata variables which should be categorical coded as
    integers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Covariates:</strong>
    the user-defined covariates in the mixture cure survival model which should
    be categorical coded as integers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Time Variable:</strong>
    the variable specified as follow-up time in the survival model.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Event Variable:</strong>
    the status indicator, 0=alive, 1=dead (due to cancer). Note that, dead
    events due to other causes should be defined as censoring events. For
    example, when an unformatted case-listing SEER*Stat data is used, a patient
    is dead due to cancer if Vitalstatusrecodestudycutoffus=dead and
    End_Calc_Vital_Status_Adjusted=dead; and a patient is dead due to other
    causes if Vitalstatusrecodestudycutoffus=dead and
    End_Calc_Vital_Status_Adjusted=(untraced or alive).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Distribution:</strong>
    the latency distribution for the cure model (non-cured survival). The
    current version can handle Weibull and log-logistic distributions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stage Variable:</strong>
    the stage variable defined in SEER*Stat data or recoded by the user, which
    should be the same variable selected in Strata if it is defined as a
    stratum. All variable names in the data set will be listed after uploading
    the SEER*Stat files. If there are more than 1 stage variable, the user will
    need to select the one which contains the distant stage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Distant Stage Value:</strong>
    the user will need to select the numeric value of distant stage from the
    listed values of Stage Variable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adjustment Factor r:</strong>
    the factor used to adjust the registry-based survival curves for sensitivity
    analysis. The user may click the up and down arrows to change the value or
    type in any value. The default value is 1.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Years of Follow-up:</strong>
    the range of follow-up years in the output. The default number is 25. If the
    maximum number of follow-up years (max.num.year) in the SEER*Stat data is
    less than 25, then the default number will be updated to the max.num.year.
  </li>
</ul>
