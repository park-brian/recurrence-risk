  This web application has been developed to estimate the risk of progressing to
  distant recurrence using disease-specific survival typically provided by
  cancer registries. The disease-specific survival is assessed via
  cause-specific survival or relative survival using SEER*Stat software. The
  cause-specific survival or relative survival is assumed to follow a
  mixture-cure model and the risk of recurrence is inferred from the survival
  among the non-cured fraction. The cure fraction and parametric survival
  distribution among those not cured are estimated using CanSurv software. The
  current version can handle Weibull and log-logistic distributions for the
  non-cured survival.

</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>SEER*Stat Dic File:</strong>
    the dictionary file exported from SEER*Stat software with .dic extension
    which contains the information describing the layout of the export data
    file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SEER*Stat Data File:</strong>
    the cause-specific survival or relative survival data generated from
    SEER*Stat in .txt format. Note that, if the .txt file is not exported from
    SEER*Stat but manually converted, the user should make sure the delimiter
    used in the txt file is the same as the one specified in the dic file -
    field delimiter option.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CanSurv CSV File:</strong>
    the CSV format output from CanSurv software including information on
    strata/covariates and estimated parameters for the mixture cure survival
    model.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stage Variable:</strong>
    the stage variable defined in SEER*Stat data. All variable names in the data
    set will be listed after uploading the SEER*Stat files. If there are more
    than 1 stage variable, the user will need to select the one which contains
    the distant stage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Distant Stage Value:</strong>
    the user will need to select the numeric value of distant stage from the
    listed values of Stage Variable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adjustment Factor r:</strong>
    the factor used to adjust the registry-based survival curves for sensitivity
    analysis. The user may click the up and down arrows to change the value or
    type in any value. The default value is 1.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Years of Follow-up:</strong>
    the range of follow-up years in the output. The default number is 25. If the
    maximum number of follow-up years (max.num.year) in the SEER*Stat data is
    less than 25, then the default number will be updated to the max.num.year.
  </li>
</ul>
